# MLflow LFI CVE-2024-2928 Detector

A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow, which was
fixed in version 2.11.2. This vulnerability arises from the application's
failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences
such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment
part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including
sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous
patched vulnerability (namely for CVE-2023-6909) that only addressed similar
manipulation within the URI's query string.
