# Agentscope Studio Arbitrary File Download Detector

This plugin for Tsunami detects publicly exposed agentscope studio instances.
The /api/file endpoint in modelscope/agentscope is vulnerable to Arbitrary File
Download, allowing attackers to retrieve internal files without restriction.
This could lead to the unintended exposure of sensitive information, including
configuration files that contain database credentials.
