# XWiki RCE CVE-2024-21650 Detector

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for
applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to a remote code execution

name" or "last name" fields during user registration. This impacts all
installations that have user registration enabled for guests. This vulnerability
has been patched in XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1. See
