# Slurm Exposed REST API

his detector checks for an exposed Slurm REST API service by running an
arbitrary command using the Tsunami Callback Server.

The Slurm Rest API requires authentication by default. However, a common
configuration involves using a reverse proxy that (in correctly-configured
environments) should authenticate the user first using some other methods and,
if successful, inject a JWT token into the request before forwarding it to the
Slurm REST API service.

If the reverse proxy is misconfigured to simply forward the requests without any
authentication steps, it will allow anyone to use the API and therefore get RCE
by submitting malicious jobs to the cluster.
