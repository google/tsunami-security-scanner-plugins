# Redis CVE-2022-0543 Vulnerability Detector

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as
a database, cache, and message broker.

Reginaldo Silva discovered that due to a packaging issue on Debian/Ubuntu, a
remote attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts could possibly
escape the Lua sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host.
