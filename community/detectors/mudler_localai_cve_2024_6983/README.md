# Mudler LocalAI RCE CVE-2024-6983 Detector

Mudler LocalAI versions before 2.19.4 are vulnerable to remote code execution.
The vulnerability arises because the localai backend receives inputs not only
from the configuration file but also from other inputs, allowing an attacker to
upload a binary file and execute malicious code. This can lead to the attacker
gaining full control over the system.
