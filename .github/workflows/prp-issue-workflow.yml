              Welcome to the Tsunami patch reward program!

              Your issue has been added to our triage queue and will reviewed
              shortly. The panel usually takes a decision once per week, so it
              can take up to a week before you hear back from us.

              Please, do not start the work until the panel has reached a
              decision. Although we always welcome contributions, unapproved
              work is not eligible for a reward.

              This issue has been put in your contributor queue. This usually
              means that you already are working on a contribution and the
              panel is waiting for your other contributions to be fully
              merged.

              An issue in your queue is not pre-approved. Any issue that is
              not explicitely approved by the panel will not be eligible for
              a reward.

              Unless there is an emergency, an issue in your queue cannot be
              claimed by another contributor.
