# Selenium Grid - Remote Code Execution via Chrome webdriver

This plugin detects RCE in an exposed Selenium Grid service via Chrome
webdriver.

It makes use --renderer-cmd-prefix parameter of Chrome browser to execute a
command.

The command provided within this parameter is added before the path to Chrome
binary and its parameters when a new Chrome instance is launched. Because of
this, some commands may not execute properly when the Chrome path/parameters are
appended to the injected command. The plugin uses curl command with '--' at the
end, to make curl treat the remaining parameters as URLs/hostnames rather than
parameters to prevent curl exiting with errors.

This plugin uses two methods to confirm that an injected command has executed:

1.  If available, it uses
    [Tsunami Callback Server](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-callback-server),
    which helps further validate findings. It executes a payload similar to:

`curl CALLBACK_URL --`

1.  If the callback server is disabled. The plugin creates a test file on the
    target by using --trace option with a uniq test string provided as a
    hostname such as:

`curl --trace /tmp/tsunami-selenium-rce tsunami-selenium-rce-3fd7b7962a51eee2
--`

Curl will fail to resolve the hostname and write it into the trace log similar
to:

```
== Info: Closing connection 23
== Info: Could not resolve host: tsunami-selenium-rce-3fd7b7962a51eee2
== Info: Closing connection 0
```

The RCE test file is then read by requesting the file with browser file:///
schema such as:

`file:///tmp/tsunami-selenium-rce`

The file is then checked for the previously injected detection string, e.g.:

`tsunami-selenium-rce-3fd7b7962a51eee2`

to determine if the curl --trace command executed.
