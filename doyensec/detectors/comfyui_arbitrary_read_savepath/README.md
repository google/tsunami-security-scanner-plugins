# Arbitrary File Read in ComfyUI Manager via save_path

## Description

In ComfyUI it's possible to leak the content of an arbitrary file on the system.
This is due to a missing check that fails to validate that the user supplied
save_path field does not escape the intended output directory.

By leveraging the `file:` protocol an attacker can read a file on the system.
After that, he can supply the webroot path, hence the file will be publicly
readable.

## Build jar file for this plugin

Using `gradlew`:

```shell

The Tsunami identifiable jar file is located at `build/libs` directory.
