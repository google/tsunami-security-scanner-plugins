"""This Python script is part of a vulnerability detection plugin for Google's Tsunami Security Scanner.

The plugin is designed to assess the Remote Code Execution (RCE) capability of
systems by deploying this script as a model in TorchServe. It handles specific
HTTP request headers to simulate various actions without creating additional
attack surface. The script's behaviors include:

- Calculating an MD5 hash for the 'tsunami-execute' header value to simulate
command execution.
- Sending a GET request to a specified URL in the 'tsunami-callback' header to
validate data exfiltration.
- Collecting basic system information in response to the 'tsunami-info' header
for aiding vulnerability mitigation.
- Logging the value of the 'tsunami-log' header to the container's standard
output.

This script is a part of an automated testing process and does not perform any
malicious activities.
In case of unexpected termination of the Tsunami plugin, this script may remain
on the system. To verify
its origin and purpose, please refer to the following repositories:

- Tsunami Security Scanner: https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner
- Tsunami RCE Plugin for TorchServe:
https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins/tree/master/doyensec/detectors/rce/torchserve

The plugin attempts to clean up by removing the model post-execution, with the
primary output being a log entry.
