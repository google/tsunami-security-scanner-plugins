# TorchServe Management API Detection Plugin

## Overview

This plugin detects and assesses the security risks of TorchServe Management API
instances. Inspired by the ShellTorch vulnerability chain (disclosed by
[Oligo Security](https://www.oligo.security/blog/shelltorch-torchserve-ssrf-vulnerability-cve-2023-43654)),
it addresses the critical risks associated with insecure configurations of
TorchServe, a widely used open-source application for serving PyTorch models in
production.

## Background

TorchServe, before version 0.8.2, bound to `0.0.0.0` by default, potentially
exposing its Management API to the internet. Since PyTorch models allow
arbitrary code execution, unrestricted model addition poses significant risks
including data leakage and user privacy breaches.

The original ShellTorch attack exploited
[CVE-2022-1471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471), a vulnerability
fixed in TorchServe 0.8.2. However, the risk of executing arbitrary code in
models remains in the latest version (0.9.0).

To mitigate these risks, TorchServe introduced the allow_urls feature, limiting
model downloads to specified sources. However, a typical `allow_urls`
configuration often includes entire services like GCP and AWS, which can be
insecure. It's important to configure `allow_urls` carefully to avoid such
vulnerabilities.

## Plugin Description

This plugin detects exposed TorchServe Management API instances, assessing the
remote code execution (RCE) risk. It supports multiple detection modes:

### Static Mode

**Description:** Manually host a model file on a web server. Most reliable,
particularly effective against lenient `allow_urls` configurations. **Use
case:** Ideal when `allow_urls` includes cloud services, posing a security risk.

```
--torchserve-management-api-mode=static --torchserve-management-api-model-static-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/model.mar
```

### Local Mode

**Description:** Serve the model via an embedded web server. Quicker setup, but
may fail against restrictive `allow_urls`. **Use case:** Best for environments
where `allow_urls` is not a limiting factor.

```
--torchserve-management-api-mode=local --torchserve-management-api-local-bind-host=tsunami --torchserve-management-api-local-bind-port=1234 --torchserve-management-api-local-accessible-url=http://mydomain.com/
```

### SSRF Mode

**Description:** Uses Tsunami's callback server as the model source. Indirect
verification of RCE risk. **Use case:** Selected when direct model serving isn't
feasible or as an additional verification layer.

```
--torchserve-management-api-mode=ssrf
```

### Basic Mode

**Description:** Default mode that relies solely on Management API
fingerprinting. **Use case:** Automatically selected when callback server isn't
available, useful as a preliminary check.

```
--torchserve-management-api-mode=basic
```
